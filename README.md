# GraphQL meets .Net6

## GraphQL vs REST
[Explanation from IBM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTfZcN20fro)  
**REST**: CRUD based on resources. It provides complete set of operations over your data. But as a drawback in complex situations may send you over-fetched or under-fetched data.  
**GraphQL**: To fetch or mutate data using exact one request. Schema+resolver you created will take care of the rest. Good in complex data situations or in situations when you want to reduce the throughput because of over-fetching.  
  
**GraphQL** also does not dicrate patterns or project structure and could be introduced on top of already existing architecture.
